## Potential Data Sources

### Requirements for New Data Sources

Per our [contribution guidelines](README.md), data sources must be:
- **Non-commercial** (preferably central banks or government institutions)
- Publish **current and historical daily rates**
- Update at the **end of each working day**
- Provide data in a structured, parseable format

### Identified Data Sources

| Data Source | Type | Coverage | Update Frequency | API/Feed URL | Notes |
|------------|------|----------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| European Central Bank (ECB) | Central Bank | 31 currencies | Daily (working days) | [XML Feed](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml) | âœ… Currently integrated |
| *Add potential sources below* | | | | | |

### Central Banks to Consider

- **National Bank of Ukraine** - For UAH
- **Bank of Russia** - For RUB (historically supported by ECB)
- **Croatian National Bank** - For HRK (historically supported by ECB)
- **Central Bank of Argentina** - For ARS
- **Reserve Bank of India** - Additional INR data
- **Bank of Thailand** - Additional THB data
- **Central Bank of Brazil** - Additional BRL data

## Implementation Priority

Priority should be based on:
1. **Frequency of requests** - How often is the currency requested?
2. **Data source reliability** - Is there a stable, non-commercial source?
3. **Geographic coverage** - Does it expand our regional coverage?
4. **User impact** - How many users would benefit?

## How to Request a New Currency

1. Check this table first to see if your currency has already been requested
2. If not listed, comment below with:
   - The currency code and name
   - Why you need this currency
   - A suggested non-commercial data source (required)
3. We'll evaluate based on the criteria above
